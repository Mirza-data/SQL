Dataset Overview
The dataset represents medical billing records, containing the following key fields:

patient_id – unique identifier for each patient

insurance_provider – the patient’s insurance company

procedure_code – medical procedure code

procedure_description – description of the procedure performed

procedure_cost – internal cost of the procedure

procedure_bill – billed amount to the patient/insurance

payment_received – actual payment received

Analysis Performed
We performed SQL-based analysis to answer common business questions, including:

Total procedures performed per insurance provider

Procedures with highest average billing amount

Procedures billed higher than cost by more than $100

Average payment received per insurance provider

Patients who paid more than 90% of their billed amount

Revenue collected per procedure type

Zero-payment procedures

Top 3 procedures with the highest payment-to-cost ratio

Insurance providers billed more than $5000 in total

Underpaid procedures where payment was lower than cost

Key Findings
Insurance Providers: Some providers had total billing exceeding $5000, indicating high business volume from those companies.

High Margin Procedures: Certain procedures were billed more than $100 above their cost, representing strong profit margins.

Payment Patterns: Some patients paid over 90% of their billed amount, showing good collection efficiency, while others had zero payments received.

Cost vs. Payment Issues: Several procedures were underpaid (payment received was less than the cost), which may indicate billing inefficiencies or insurance disputes.

Top Ratios: A few procedures had very high payment-to-cost ratios, suggesting priority areas for the hospital to focus on for profitability.

Conclusion
The dataset helped demonstrate how SQL can be applied to real-world healthcare billing scenarios, identifying revenue drivers, inefficiencies, and payment behaviors.
Such insights can assist finance teams in improving billing strategies, optimizing revenue collection, and negotiating better terms with insurance providers.
